\description{
It takes a network and it calculates wich species is the most conected
of the network, then it extinguishes that species, and calculates the
secundary extintions. After that it recalculates the conections and
repeats the process until every species becomes extinct.
The most connected species are define like is defined as that species
that has the highest value of the total degree. A secondary extinction occurs when following a primary removal,
any remaining species lost all of their resources species (Sol√© et al. 2001, Dunne et al. 2002, Dunne & Williams 2009)
